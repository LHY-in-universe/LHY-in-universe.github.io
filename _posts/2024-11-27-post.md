DMC & VMC
======

  This blog will introduce quantum Monte Carlo including Duffision Monte and Carlo and Variational Monte Carlo. But I just give a main idea of how to understand DMC and VMC.

  In fact, the most inportant part is very detailed, like how to let those method more effective. Other way, I learn from ZJR that VMC is very different in quantum chemisity and many body physics. He is focus on using VMC and tension network to do simulation in MPS and PEPS.
